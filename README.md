# Community Bounty: Token Distribution I Sybil Hunting

It is no secret that there are bots and illegitimate users who try to use multiple addresses and accounts to sybil attack a protocol’s governance system. If they succeed, Increment’s protocol governance and community will be at risk of centralization and potential bad actors.

In order to distribute INCR to as many legitimate users as possible within the Increment community and mitigate this kind of attack towards our protocol governance, it will be necessary to call on the community for help in finding and reporting any potential cases of sybil attacks in the current list of eligible addresses in this bounty hunting event. 

Successful bounty reports will eliminate all sybil addresses in the bounty report from the token distribution, except for one random address in the bounty report which will still receive token distribution (Sybil resistance is important, but allowing users to participate in Increment governance is equally important).

# How to Participate

This repository will be used for submitting and reviewing community bounty reports. The goal is to find 5 addresses or more that are linked to the same person or entity and provide a valid reason for such finding. We will use [Arkham](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/) as the third party provider to check if the submitted sybil bounty report is valid.
